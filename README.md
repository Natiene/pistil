# Pistil

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm test`

## About this project

This project is a web application where the database is searched and printed on the screen.

I used some tools to standardize the project such as:

### `husky`
### `editorconfig`

### `eslint`

### `prettier`

I chose tailwindcss because it's simple, elegant and has a great code standard.

To had a better user experience, I did an infinity scroll using the IntersectionObserver api from javascript. I used firebase over nosql because I didn't have enough time to setup a backend project, but I faced some problems with pagination. 

To improve this project we can solve the problem with pagination and sort.

Of course, we can improve the layout too.

I let a `Current Page = ${}` just to show pagination working.
